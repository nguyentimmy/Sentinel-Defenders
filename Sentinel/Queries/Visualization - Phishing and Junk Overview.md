### [+] Description 
This visualization retrieves security alerts related to potentially malicious activities in email and URLs, including junk emails, malware or phish emails, potentially malicious URL clicks, and phishing emails detected at the time of delivery. The query filters alerts based on their names and returns a count of each type of alert. This information can be useful in identifying potential threats and taking proactive measures to mitigate them. 

### [+] Thoughts
‚ùó Phishing attacks are one of the most dangerous types of cyber attacks as they prey on human error and exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technical vulnerabilities. These attacks use social engineering techniques to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, downloading malware, or performing some other action that can compromise security. Phishing attacks are often successful because they are difficult to detect, and they can result in significant financial loss, reputational damage, and even legal consequences. It is essential to educate individuals about the risks of phishing and to implement strong security measures to prevent these attacks from succeeding.

### [+] Recommended Actions
1. It is crucial to immediately investigate any alerts triggered when a user clicks on a potentially malicious link. Failure to take prompt action could result in serious security breaches and compromise the entire network.
