# Malware & Ransomware Playbook

1. Notify User: Notify the user that they clicked on a potentially malicious link and instruct them to immediately disconnect from the network or Wi-Fi, if possible. Advise them to avoid accessing any sensitive data until further notice.

2. Notify Manager: Notify the manager of the user and provide a brief explanation of the situation. This should include any potential impact on the business and the user's work.

3. Isolate or Disconnect: If possible, isolate or disconnect the affected device from the network or Wi-Fi. This can help prevent the spread of any malware or viruses that may have been downloaded.
Isolating is the best method, this allows your EDR/XDR to scan for malware and perform further forensic analysis

4. Send Password Reset Link: Send the user a password reset link to ensure their account is secure. Advise the user to follow the instructions in the password reset email and create a new, strong password.

5. Scan for Malware: Run a malware scan on the affected device to check for any signs of malware or viruses that may have been downloaded.

6. Clean and Reconnect: Once the malware scan is complete and no threats are found, clean and reconnect the device to the network or Wi-Fi.
